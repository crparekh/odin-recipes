   <p>The following recipe has been inspired by
    <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/26819/hot-artichoke-and-spinach-dip-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Allrecipes' artchoke dip</a>
    recipe. I have made my own additions to this recipe to make it a little more of my own. However, the base recipe on their website is more than good enough and I highly recommend it as well. This recipe calls for a hot dish version of Spinach artichoke dip. This works well as an appetizer or side dish. Just pop it into the oven until golden brown and serve. Serving with crackers or chips or veggies is good but I think my personal favourite is using <em>naan dippers</em> to really get your scoop on and get as much of this wonderful dip as you can with each bite. <em>This dish is going to go in a hurry</em>
