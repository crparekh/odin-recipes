   <p>The following recipe has been inspired by
    <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/26819/hot-artichoke-and-spinach-dip-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Allrecipes' artchoke dip</a>
    recipe. I have made my own additions to this recipe to make it a little more of my own. However, the base recipe on their website is more than good enough and I highly recommend it as well.
